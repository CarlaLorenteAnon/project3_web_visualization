# Project 3: What is your ideal place to link?

##The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map that users could toggle through to find cities that would fit their needs if they moved locations. There are multiple tile layers to look through as well as pop-ups on the points so a user can get the facts for their selected location. There is also a chart page that has data on the happiest cities to live that is interactive for the user.
